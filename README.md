## Installing

* When the application is running, **H2** (data in memory) will create the necessary tables along with sample data.

* 	Transfer API is accessible at : **http://localhost:8080/api/balance/transfer**

#### Running the application with IDE

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.natwest.transfer.TransferServiceApplication` class from your IDE.

* 	Download the zip or clone the Git repository.
* 	Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)
* 	Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml
* 	Open Eclipse
	* File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip
	* Select the project
* 	Choose the Spring Boot Application file (search for @SpringBootApplication)
* 	Right Click on the file and Run as Java Application

#### Running the application with Maven

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/kedarjavalkar/transfer-service.git
$ cd transfer-service
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### Running the application with Executable JAR

The code can also be built into a jar and then executed/run. Once the jar is built, run the jar by double clicking on it or by using the command 

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/kedarjavalkar/transfer-service.git
$ cd transfer-service
$ mvn package -DskipTests
$ java -jar target\transfer-service-0.0.1.jar
```

To shutdown the jar, follow the below mentioned steps on a Windows machine.

*	**Taskkill /PID PROCESS_ID_OF_RUNNING_APP /F** execute this command by replacing the **PROCESS_ID_OF_RUNNING_APP** with the actual process id of the running jar found out from executing the previous command


#### Accessing Data in H2 Database

URL to access H2 console: **http://localhost:8080/api/h2-database/**

Fill the login form as follows and click on Connect:

* 	Saved Settings: **Generic H2 (Embedded)**
